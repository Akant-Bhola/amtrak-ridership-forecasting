# Amtrak Ridership â€” Regression-Based Forecasting Models

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project applies regression and seasonal time series modeling to forecast Amtrak ridership over a 13-year period.
Multiple model types were tested â€” **linear, exponential, polynomial, seasonal, and combined trend + seasonal** â€” to identify ridership patterns, evaluate model performance, and interpret the dominant seasonal trends.

The goal was to translate raw time-series data into actionable forecasting insights using Python.

## ðŸ§  Key Objectives

* Build interpretable regression models to predict monthly ridership.
* Quantify trend and seasonality effects.
* Compare model performance using RÂ² and diagnostic plots.
* Communicate insights through clean visualizations and written interpretation.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

* **Python** (Jupyter / Google Colab)
* **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preprocessing
* **Statsmodels** for OLS regression and time-series modeling
* **Matplotlib** for visualizations
* **Scikit-learn** for evaluation utilities

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Model                     | Description                      | Key Metric                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Linear                    | Simple trend line                | Weak fit (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.006)     |
| Exponential               | Log-linear growth                | Minimal improvement       |
| Polynomial                | Captures curvature               | RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.174                |
| Seasonal                  | Monthly dummy variables          | **Best fit (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.647)** |
| Combined Trend + Seasonal | Adds linear trend to seasonality | RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.649                |

### Interpretation

* Strong seasonal pattern dominates ridership variation.
* Peaks in **Marchâ€“August**, lowest in **Januaryâ€“February**.
* After controlling for seasonality, long-term trend is relatively stable.

## ðŸ“˜ Insights

* Seasonal variation explains most of the ridership change, suggesting allocation and scheduling strategies should follow monthly cycles.
* Demonstrates ability to conduct complete analytical workflow â€” data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and interpretation.
* Strong foundation for applying regression-based forecasting in business analytics and demand planning contexts.
